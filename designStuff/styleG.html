            My intention with this website is to create a experience 
            that plays on nostalgia and how it realates to having grown up 
            being exposed to the internet. I want this website to mirror 
            my earlies memorable exerinces of interacting with the internet. 
            I would also like to explore the ideas of what it 
            means to have existed in online spaces as a female growing up and 
            how that has had an influence on the way I think and interact with 
            the internet as well as the world.
